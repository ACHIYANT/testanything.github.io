<a id="ada"></a>
## Ada

> Ada is a modern programming language designed for large,
> long-lived applications – and embedded systems in particular –
> where safety and security are essential.
>
> *From [Ada Information Clearinghouse](http://www.adaic.org/)*

**[Ahven](http://ahven.stronglytyped.org/)** is a unit test library
for Ada which produces TAP 12 output.

<a id="c"></a>
## C

### C TAP Harness
Russ Alberry has a C TAP library available [here](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/).

### [GLib's GTest](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Testing.html)
Test executables that use `g_test_init()` present their results as TAP if run with the `--tap` option.

### LibTap
-    [Original version (unmaintained)](http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/LibTap)
-    [Maintenance version by Shlomi Fish](http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/libtap/)
-    [Maintenance version by Rusty Russell as part of CCAN](http://ccan.ozlabs.org/info/tap.html)
-    [Article about LibTap](http://use.perl.org/~nik/journal/22137)
(This library appears to no longer be under active development. It also suffers from an non-POSIX thread implementation. If you remove the thread ifdefs from tap.c it does compile and run however.)

### MyTAP (for MySQL)
MyTAP is a TAP producer for C. It is the unit testing framework used inside the MySQL Server

-    [Testing C and C++ using MyTAP](http://www.kindahl.net/mytap/doc/)
-    [MyTAP](http://theory.github.io/mytap/)

### Yet Another libtap
Another library for producing tap in C that compiles without much work on the dumbest (no special library requirements) of Unix-like and Windows development environments. It is feature-full (ok, is, isnt, like, unlike, todo, skip, dies_ok, cmp_ok, etc...), consistent (todo until endtodo, skip until endskip), extendable, and keeps track of file-line information (like test::More does). It also uses macros in nice ways so the user can leave out the message portion at the end of the test ok(1) and ok(1, "hello %s", "world") are both valid.

## C++

> C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards
