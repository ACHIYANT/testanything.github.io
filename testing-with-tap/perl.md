# Testing with Perl

## Testing with Perl 5

There are a number of test modules for Perl, ranging from very simple tests through to very complex tests.
Here are some links to some of them; all of these use the Test Anything Protocol to report their successes or failures:

-    [Test::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Simple)
-    [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More)
-    [Test::Exception](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Exception)

### A number of harnesses are available including:

-    [TAP::Harness](https://metacpan.org/pod/TAP::Harness)

## Testing with Perl 6

A set of test files, designed to output TAP, are used to define the specification for Perl 6.
Only a few modules exist, but Test is a core module for every implementation that produces Test Anything Protocol output.
