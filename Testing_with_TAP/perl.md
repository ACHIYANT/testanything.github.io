# Testing with Perl

## Testing with Perl

There are a number of test modules for Perl, ranging from very simple tests through to very complex tests.
Here are some links to some of them; all of these use the Test Anything Protocol to report their successes or failures:

-    [Test::Simple](http://search.cpan.org/~mschwern/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Simple.pm)
-    [Test::More](http://search.cpan.org/~mschwern/Test-Simple/lib/Test/More.pm)
-    [Test::Exception](http://search.cpan.org/~adie/Test-Exception/lib/Test/Exception.pm)

### A number of harnesses are available including:

-    [TAP::Harness](http://search.cpan.org/~andya/Test-Harness/lib/TAP/Harness.pm)
-    [Test::Harness](http://search.cpan.org/~andya/Test-Harness/lib/Test/Harness.pm)
